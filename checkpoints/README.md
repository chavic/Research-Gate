# Strategy Checkpoints

Use this folder to capture immutable snapshots of significant discoveries (e.g., stable feature sets, signal versions, allocator/risk configs, full strategy releases). For each checkpoint create a subfolder with:

- `SUMMARY.md` – description of the idea, metrics, and date of creation.
- Any supporting configs/notebooks/exports needed to reproduce the result.
- Links to Lean backtests, research log entries, or deployment notes.

Keep checkpoints read-only (no iterative edits) so we can trace the evolution of strategies over time.
