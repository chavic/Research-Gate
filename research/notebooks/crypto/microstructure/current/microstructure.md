# Microstructure Notebook Hub

## Notebook
- `idea_bank_orderbooks.ipynb` – order-book data structures, microstructure strategies, live simulation tests, and performance summaries. Older snapshots now live under `../legacy/`.

## Usage Notes
- Capture exchange-specific quirks or latency assumptions here for quick reference.
- Align any reusable order-book utilities with `research/scripts/` if they are needed outside the notebook.
- Log significant regime tests in the research log so you can correlate with signal/AI findings.
