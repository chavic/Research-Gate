# Risk Notebook Hub

## Notebook
- `risks.ipynb` – catalog of position sizing, leverage control, trade/portfolio risk checks, adaptive overlays, and experimental comparisons.

## Usage Notes
- Record which strategies/algos consume each overlay so you can trace coverage.
- When you validate a risk module, document parameter defaults here and export the code to `research/scripts/` or LEAN code.
- Align research log entries with major changes (new overlay, new backtest regime, etc.).
