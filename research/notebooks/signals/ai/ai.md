# AI Notebook Hub

## Notebooks
- `idea_bank_ai_r1.ipynb` – AI-driven alpha concepts (order-book gap fill, next-candle GPT ensemble, genetic pipelines, horizon stacking, roadmap).
- `idea_bank_hrm.ipynb` – hierarchical reasoning model for next-price prediction.

## Workflow Tips
- Keep track of dataset versions/models used; reference them here for reproducibility.
- When prototypes mature, migrate core components into scripts or LEAN modules and list the target path.
- Note cross-links with signal or microstructure experiments when AI models consume those features.
